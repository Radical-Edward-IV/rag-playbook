LLM 애플리케이션의 전체 수명주기를 단순화합니다.\\n- 표준 인터페이스 및 확장성: LLM, 임베딩 모델, 벡터 스토어 등 여러 구성요소에 대한 표준 인터페이스를 제공하고, 수백 개의 프로바이더와의 통합을 지원합니다. 프로바이더 간 교체를 쉽게 할 수 있도록 설계되어 있습니다.\\n- 아키텍처 구성요소: 오픈 소스 라이브러리로\\n  - langchain-core: 챗 모델 및 기타 컴포넌트의 기본 추상화\\n  - integration 패키지(langchain-openai 등): 주요 통합\\n  - langchain: 체인, 에이전트, 검색 전략 등 애플리케이션의 인지 아키텍처 구성요소\\n  - langchain-community: 커뮤니티가 유지하는 3자 통합\\n  -
